# Welcome to the EPS Technical Theatre Guide

## What is this?
In the coming months, this repository will make home to a wiki of information for students interested in technical theatre to learn and refine their skills. A prettier version will eventually be found at [the Github page for this project](https://epstechtheatre.github.io/)

Currently, the wiki is primarily mainted by Ben MacDonald ([Who can be found here](https://github.com/Quantum158/)), the Technical Director at E.P Scarlett in 2020-2021.

## Progress
This project is in its early stages. A project board will be created eventually once we have a grasp at what we want the end product to look like
Project boards can be found in the [Projects Tab](https://github.com/epstechtheatre/epstechtheatre.github.io/projects)

## Contributing and Contact
I encourage future students to share any new knowledge they acquire on this page as well, however, I do realize Github can be quite intimidating to those with no prior experience in programming. If you need any support, send an email to [epstechtheatre@gmail.com](mailto:epstechtheatre@gmail.com) with "Tech Theatre Wiki" in the subject line.
