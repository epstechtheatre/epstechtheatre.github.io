# Welcome to the EPS Technical Theatre Guide

## What is this?
In the coming months, this repository will make home to a wiki of information for students interested in technical theatre to learn and refine their skills. A prettier can be found at [the Github page for this project](https://epstechtheatre.github.io/)

Currently, the wiki is primarily maintained by Benjamin MacDonald ([Who can be found here](https://github.com/Quantum158/)), the Technical Director at E.P Scarlett during the 2020-2021 school year.

## Progress
This project is in its early stages. Check the [Projects Board](https://github.com/epstechtheatre/epstechtheatre.github.io/projects) for information.

## Contributing and Contact
I encourage future students to share any new knowledge they acquire on this page as well, however, I do realize Github can be quite intimidating to those with no prior experience in programming. A contribution tutorial is being drafted and eventually will be posted to the website. If you need any support, send an email to [epstechtheatre@gmail.com](mailto:epstechtheatre@gmail.com) with "Tech Theatre Wiki" in the subject line.
