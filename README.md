# Welcome to the EPS Technical Theatre Guide

## What is this?
In the coming months, this repository will make home to a wiki of information for students interested in technical theatre to learn and refine their skills. A prettier version will eventually be found at [the Github page for this project](https://epstechtheatre.github.io/)

Currently, the wiki is primarily mainted by Benjamin MacDonald ([Who can be found here](https://github.com/Quantum158/)), the Technical Director at E.P Scarlett for 2020-2021.

## Contributing and Contact
I encourage future students to share any new knowledge they acquire on this page as well, however, I do realize Github can be quite intimidating to those with no prior experience in programming. If you need any support, send an email to [epstechtheatre@gmail.com](mailto:epstechtheatre@gmail.com) with "Tech Theatre Wiki" in the subject line.
