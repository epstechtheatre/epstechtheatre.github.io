Sorry, but the page you were trying to view does not exist, hasn't been created yet, or was deleted. Try searching for it or looking at the URL to see if it looks correct.


<div>
    Alternatively, to return home, <a id="404-noscript" href="{{site.host_url}}">click here</a>
</div>
<script>
    const linkEl = document.createElement("a")
    linkEl.href = window.location.origin;
    linkEl.innerHTML = "click here";

    document.getElementById("404-noscript").replaceWith(linkEl);
</script>
