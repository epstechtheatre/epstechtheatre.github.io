{% include note.html content="If you are coming from a school other than E.P. Scarlett, hello! This wiki was tailored to the systems we have and use. There is a good chance this will not line up with the systems at your school. If this is the case, I hope you will still find a use for these guides." %}

## Welcome!
Here you will find a ton of information for students interested in technical theatre. From Lighting to Set; Costume to Sound, my hope is the information provided here will help to reduce the learning curve that is commonly associated with the work we do. These guides may not cover everything but we will try to provide as much information as we can.

## Sounds cool but who are you?
We are a passionate group of students interested in all aspects of the technical theatre world. Many of us are actors too. We started this project as a volunteer initiative due to the impact that Covid-19 had on our training program. This wiki will help new students coming to the school that won't get the benefit of learning from a technician with 3 years of experience. 

The project was started and is currently led by [Ben MacDonald](https://github.com/Quantum158/). They were the Technical Director at Dr. E.P. Scarlett Highschool during the 2020-2021 school year and will help maintain the project at least until they complete their bachelor's degree.

## I want to help out! Where can I contribute?
Glad to hear! This wiki is open-source on Github. If you have programming experience and a Github account, feel free to submit a pull request.

If you don't want to, or don't know how to use Github, you can still help out! [Fill out this form](https://forms.gle/jRTGT4GuW7Re5r586) using a email that works with Google Drive and we will automatically create a file that you can work in. It will already be shared with the right people too, so you don't have to worry about that.

If you need any help, don't hesitate to send an email to [techwiki@b-macdonald.ca](mailto:techwiki@b-macdonald.ca).

## Where do I go first?
The website is divide into categories and topics. If you know roughly what you're looking for, try searching for it using the search bar in the top right of the webpage (or in the dropdown menu on mobile). Otherwise, have a click around and see what you can find. 

If you're just getting started in tech theatre, I strongly suggest you take a look at the Getting Started guides and overviews that you can find for [lighting](./Lighting) (more categories to be added in the future).

You can also click on the tag below to have a look at all the pages targeted at those just getting started.

Have fun!
