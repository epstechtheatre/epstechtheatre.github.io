## Welcome

In the coming months, this wiki will grow into a home of information for students interested in technical theatre. My hope is this will help to reduce the learning curve that is commonly associated with the work we do. This guide will cover everything from lighting to sound (maybe), beginner to advanced.

## Sounds cool but who are you?


<TODO: A list of other wonderful people that deserve more credit than I can give them here>

## Woah, this is a lot of information. Is it all complete?

Well... Not yet. Actually, I hope it never will be. My goal is that this will serve as a hub years down the line where students can keep coming back to share cool things they learned.

With that being said, currently I have finished 0% of the pages I want want to add.

## I want to help out! Where can I contribute?

Glad to hear! This wiki is open-source on Github. If you have programming experience and a Github account, feel free to follow the instructions over on the repo to submit a pull request.

### What if I'm not a programmer?

That's all right too! Send an email to [epstechtheatre@gmail.com](mailto:epstechtheatre@gmail.com) and I or someone else will help you out.

## Well how do I get started?

Easy! The website is divide into categories and topics. If you know roughly what you're looking for, try searching for it using the search bar in the top right of the webpage. Otherwise, have a click around and see what you can find. 

If you're just getting started in tech theatre, I strongly suggest you take a look at the Getting Started guides and overviews that you can find for [lighting](Lighting_landing_page) and for [sound](Sound_landing_page).
