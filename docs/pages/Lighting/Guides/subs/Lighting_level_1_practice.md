You will not be asked to:

# Task
Create a new showfile from the mainfile. Using the methods you have learned, build a cue list with the following features:

- A light that transitions from 0% to 50%
- A light that transitions from 100% to 20%
- A group of lights that transition to a new intensity at the same time
- A cue where each light transitions to a new and unique intensity. Ensure some lights increase their intensity and some decrease it.
- A cue in the middle of your cue list that is a complete blackout

- A cue where each light transitions to a different colour. Make sure to utilize both lights that have linear colour selection and step-based colour selection
- A cue that transitions a parameter other than colour or intensity

# Sample
A cue list demonstrating the above requirements is available for [download](/db/Lighting_level_1_practice_solution.zip).

See the tutorial on [Running EOS on a Separate Computer](./Lighting_tutorial_eos_off_console.html) for more info on opening the sample.
