In this category on the sidebar, you can find information on various lighting hardware present in our theatre. Much of it looks complicated at first but follows very simple rules. Some systems you will only need to use occasionally. Others (like the snaps) you will likely use a lot.

Additionally, each page will have a section for common tasks that are performed on them. If you are looking for a guide on how to do a certain thing, you will probably find it there.
