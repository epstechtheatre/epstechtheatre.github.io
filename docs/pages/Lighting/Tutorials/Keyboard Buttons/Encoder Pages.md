{% include note.html content="Details on the Encoder Display button are lower down on this page." %}


There are six property categories:

- {% include console_button.html content="Intensity" %}
- {% include console_button.html content="Focus" %}
- {% include console_button.html content="Color" %}
- {% include console_button.html content="Shutter" %}
- {% include console_button.html content="Image" %}
- and {% include console_button.html content="Form" %}

### Intensity
Typically only contains one property: The Brightness of the Light. Brightness is always controllable by the {% include console_button.html content="Manual Wheel" %}.

### Focus
Contains the `Pan` and `Tilt` properties of moving lights. Also contains lesser used properties like `Position Speed`, which controls the maximum speed of the light when moving.

### Color
Contains individual diode colours, like on the cyc, as well as scroller frames. Both linear and non-linear properties exist here. Non-linear properties are control the exact same was as linear properties.

### Shutter
Not super common with traditional lights. Lights that have mechanized shutters can use this page.

### Image
Not super command with traditional lights. Contains properties that manipulate the `Gobos`, `Animation Frames`, and `Refraction Patterns`.

### Form
Contains properties such as `Strobe`, `Edge`, and `Zoom`.

## Usage
To select a page, hold down {% include console_button.html content="Encoder Display" %} and then click the key for the page you want to select.
{% capture note1 %}
If you aren't using a keyboard with the {% include console_button.html content="Encoder Display" %} button, you do not need to hold it down to select an encoder page.
{% endcapture %}

{% include note.html content=note1 %}

You can also use these buttons to directly add the name of the property to your current command. Hold down {% include console_button.html content="Shift" %} and click the key.
## Examples
You want change to the colour page to manipulate the cyc. Use {% include console_button.html content="Encoder Display" %} and {% include console_button.html content="Color" %}

You want to home the Color properties for channel 1. Type {% include console_button.html content="1" %}, {% include console_button.html content="Shift" %} + {% include console_button.html content="Color" %}, {% include console_button.html content="Home" %}, {% include console_button.html content="Enter" %}.
## On Keyboard
None of the Encoder Pages are mapped to a key. However, you can change pages from within the Encoder Display menu on the monitor. You can also directly select properties from this area.
