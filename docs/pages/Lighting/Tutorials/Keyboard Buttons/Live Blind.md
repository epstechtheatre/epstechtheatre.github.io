summary: Live and Blind mode are the two programming modes on the console. In live mode, commands you run are immediately displayed on stage, while in blind mode, changes you make are done silently in the background.

## Usage

### Live
You will be acting in Live mode most often

{% include console_button.html content="Live" %} is used to enter `Live` Mode. see [Live Mode](./WIP.html) for more information.

{% include important.html content="If you have a command in progress and you change from Live mode to Blind mode, or vise versa. Your command will be cleared." %}

### Blind
Most target modifications take place in {% include console_button.html content="Blind" %} mode. This included: Building Groups, Palettes, Presets, Subs, and more.

In shows, Blind mode is used to modify cues without displaying the cue on-stage (hence the "Blind" part). **Most changes done in Blind mode automatically and immediately save your changes, without having to rerecord or update anything.**

{% include important.html content="If you have an command in the command line and change to blind mode, your command will be cleared." %}

{% include warning.html content="Clicking on some tabs will change what mode you are in. <b>Always check that you are in the right mode before entering a command!</b> If you aren't editing a group or doing anything special <u>You almost always want to be in live mode.</u>" %}


## On Keyboard
