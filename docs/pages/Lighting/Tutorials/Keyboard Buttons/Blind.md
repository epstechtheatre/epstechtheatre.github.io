## Usage
Most target modifications take place in {% include console_button.html content="Blind" %} mode. This included: Building Groups, Palettes, Presets, Subs, and more.

In shows, Blind mode is used to modify cues without displaying the cue on-stage (hence the "Blind" part).

{% include important.html content="If you have an command in the command line and change to blind mode, your command will be cleared." %}

See [Live](./Lighting_keyboard_live.html) for more info.
## On Keyboard
{% include console_button.html content="Blind" %} is mapped to `F2` on a QWERTY keyboard.
