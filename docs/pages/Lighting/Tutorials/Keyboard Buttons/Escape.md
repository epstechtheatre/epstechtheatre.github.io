## Usage
Escape does not cancel or pause operations, like it does in some computer programs. Instead it attempts to close the currently active window. You can press escape at any time, although if your command is operating in the active window's context, you will reset your command line.
## Examples
Close a magic sheet, duplicate tab, or any other un-needed window but selecting the tab and pressing {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Escape" %}.

Close out of the "New Magic Sheet" selector by pressing escape.

{% include important.html content="You cannot use Escape to cancel confirmation prompts, for example, the ones generated by attempting to delete a cue." %}.


## On Keyboard
{% include lighting/console_button.html content="Escape" %} is mapped to `Escape` on a QWERTY keyboard.
