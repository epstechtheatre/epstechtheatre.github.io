## Usage
Escape does not cancel or pause operations, like it does in some computer programs. Instead it attempts to close the currently active window. You can press escape at any time, although if your command is operating in the active window's context, you will reset your command line.
## Examples

<!-- Leave the linkID blank if you want to be able to open multiple sections at once.
Otherwise, only one panel can be open at a time per linkUID.
panelUID must be unique to all other faq panels on this page -->

{% include faq/opening.html linkUID='' %}

{% capture CloseTabCallout %}
Depending on your open tabs and the tab you just closed, the board may switch into or out of [Live Mode](Lighting_keyboard_live_blind.html). You can tell if this has happened by the current state of the lights on the {% include console_button.html content="Live" %} and {% include console_button.html content="Blind" %} buttons.<br><br>If you are in Live Mode, an orange light will be visible on the {% include console_button.html content="Live" %} button, and the word "Blind" will not be present in any of the upper corners of either monitor.
{% endcapture %}


{% capture CloseTab %}
Simply click on the tab using your mouse pointer to select it, then press {% include console_button.html content="Escape" %}.
{% include warning.html content=CloseTabCallout %}

{% endcapture %}


{% include faq/panel.html panelUID='CloseTab' title='Close a magic sheet, duplicate tab, or un-needed or mistakenly opened window' body=CloseTab linkUID='' startOpen='true' %}

{% include faq/closing.html%}

{% include important.html content="You cannot use Escape to cancel confirmation prompts, for example, the ones generated by attempting to delete a cue. You must use your mouse pointer to hit `Cancel`." %}


## On Keyboard
{% include console_button.html content="Escape" %} is mapped to `Escape` on a QWERTY keyboard.
