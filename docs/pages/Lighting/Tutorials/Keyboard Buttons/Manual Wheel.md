## Usage
The {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Manual Wheel" %} can only control light intensity, not colour or any other property. Spinning the wheel upward increases the intensity, and spinning the wheel downward decreases the intensity.

The {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Manual Wheel" %} has complex usages, see the examples below.

## Examples
When working on a scene, use the {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Manual Wheel" %} to quickly play with different light levels.

### Complex Examples
Some softkeys modify the functionality of the manual wheel

{% include lighting/console_command.html content="Group 1, {Fan}, Enter" noLegend=true noTip=true %}
Makes the lights in Group 1 "Fan" from 0% to 100% across the group


## On Keyboard
The {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Manual Wheel" %} is not mapped to any key.
