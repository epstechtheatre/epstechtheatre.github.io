## Usage
The {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Dot" %} is used to add decimals to targets. This is used most commonly in cue ID's. Targets that allow decimal numbers can use up to three decimal places.
## Examples
<!-- Leave the linkID blank if you want to be able to open multiple sections at once.
Otherwise, only one panel can be open at a time per linkUID.
panelUID must be unique to all other faq panels on this page -->

{% include faq/opening.html linkUID='' %}

{% capture Decimal %}
{% include lighting/console_command.html content="Record, Cue, 1, ., 5, Enter" noLegend=true noTip=true %}
{% include callout.html type="success" content="This command would record the current live state in to Cue 1.5.<br><br>Decimal cues still obey the rules of ascending order. As such, this cue would play after Cue 1, but before Cue 2." %}

{% endcapture %}

{% capture whenToUse %}
A very typical reason to use decimal cues is when making additions to the cue list far in the future and not accounting for the fact that you may have to do so. It is far more convenient and efficient to add a decimal cue rather than renumber every cue in the list.

<br><br>
Other than that, some techs like to use decimal cues as a personal marker to represent what type of cue it is.<br><br>
For example, I used decimal cues for any cue activated by a follow time. This way, when I run the cue in a show or many weeks after programming a sequence, I'm aware of what the intention of the cue list was and am less prone to misfiring cues.
