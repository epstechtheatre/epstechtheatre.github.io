## Usage
{% include console_button.html content="Help" %} can be used to get information about a key on the keyboard. Simply hold down the {% include console_button.html content="Help" %} key and press another button. A popup will appear on the monitor. Press {% include console_button.html content="Help" %} again to close the popup, or hit "Close"

You can also find links to manual pages in the Help Popups. Click them with your cursor to open the manual pdf, right on the console.

EOS uses a special convention for their buttons. Square brackets represent hardkeys ("\[1\]") and curly brackets represent softkeys ("{Focus}")

## On Keyboard
{% include console_button.html content="Help" %} is mapped to `ALT + /`.
