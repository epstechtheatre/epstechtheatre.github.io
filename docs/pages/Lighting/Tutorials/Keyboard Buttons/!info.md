## Welcome to the keyboard buttons guide

This folder will eventually contain information for every single button on the EOS keyboard. 

The goal of this section is to provide a simplified subset of the information already provided by ETC that is more approachable to a beginner. It also contains examples and usage cases.

<br>

Remember that at any time, you can hold down {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Help" %} and click any button on the keypad to open a help page right on the console
(click help again to close the help window).
