## Usage
When you are down with the console, press the {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Power" %} button to turn it off. When you do this, you will be asked if you really want to turn on the console. Click OK or press the {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Power" %} button again.

Holding the {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Power" %} button down kills the power just like any other computer, and just like any other computer **this should only be done if the system is not responding**

## On Keyboard
{% include lighting/console_button.html content="Power" %} is not mapped to any key. If you are running EOS on a laptop, you can just close the application, or shut off the laptop.
