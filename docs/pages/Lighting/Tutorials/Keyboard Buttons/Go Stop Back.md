## Usage
The usage of this is quite simple. Press {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Go" %} to go forwards one cue and press {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Stop / Back" %} to go back one cue.

If you press {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Stop / Back" %} before the present cue has finished transitioning, you will not go back a cue and instead pause the transition. Pressing {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Stop/ Back" %} again will go back a cue and pressing {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Go" %} will resume the transition timer.

If you have multiple cue lists mapped to multiple faders, use the controls associated with that cue list to manipulate the active cue.

## Examples
You stage manager has just said "Lights Go". Press {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Go" %}

You pressed go by mistake. Press {% include lighting/console_button.html content="Stop / Back" %} to try and cover up your mistake (be careful not to press it too many times though!).
## On Keyboard
{% include lighting/console_button.html content="Go" %} is mapped to `Spacebar` on a QWERTY keyboard. "Go on Spacebar" must be enabled though. Follow the prompts that appear to enable this (Alt + G toggles the availability of the keybind).

{% include lighting/console_button.html content="Stop / Back" %} is mapped to `CTRL + Spacebar` on a QWERTY keyboard. Unlike Go, this keybind is always available.
