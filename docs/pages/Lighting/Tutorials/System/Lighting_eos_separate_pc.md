First, [download EOS from the ETC website](https://www.etcconnect.com/Products/Consoles/Eos-Family/Eos-Ti/Software.aspx). There are several versions of the software available. You are looking for the latest version (as of writing, version 3.0.2). If you are on a Mac, make sure you select the Mac version of the software.

If you are struggling to find the right download. Here are direct links:

| Version | Windows                                                                           | Mac                                                                               |

| 2.9.2   | [download](https://www.etcconnect.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=10737504265) | [download](https://www.etcconnect.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=10737504264) |

Install EOS like you would any other computer application.

Using this version of the software is functionally identical to on a lighting console. The only differences is that you don't have a keypad and you can't output to a real stage. I strongly recommend that you take a look at the [Lighting Keyboard Tutorial Pages](./Lighting_keyboard_buttons_info.html), as they contain information on keybinds that you will find helpful. You can also open a virtual keyboard tab (Tab 7), or use the virtual keyboard popover located in the top right of the monitor display. 

{% include tip.html content="Remember that EOS runs through a program launcher. When opening the program, if asked. Click \"Offline\" to open into the actual software." %}
