## Welcome to the Lighting Page

In this section, you will find guides on various lighting equipment and general lighting concepts. If you are new to lighting, we recommend starting with the [guides](./Lighting_level_0.md).


## Wiki Structure
You will find two types of pages: Guides and Tutorials.

Guides are written loosely and may contain a lot of information that you don't necessarily need. They are meant to be read through while you are at a console. All guides are currently in the "Guides" directory on the sidebar.

Tutorials are specific and don't contain any information out of scope. They read more like documentation (but because of that, they are easier to write).

<br><br>

Currently, the goal of the project is to provide as much content as possible. This means, tutorials will be the most common type of page. When this is complete, some tutorials may be converted into guides (especially if there is demand).
