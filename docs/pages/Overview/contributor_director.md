There are two ways you can edit a page. The most direct way is by editing it directly on Github, which you can do by <a id="contribute-github-link" href="https://github.com/epstechtheatre/epstechtheatre.github.io">clicking here</a>

The second way is by using the public writing form on Google Drive. <a id="contribute-form-link" href="https://links.b-macdonald.ca/wikisurvey">Click here</a> to request a writing page for your contribution.
