- Why they are a good idea
  - As in, syntax highlighting
  - Automatic push/pull to github
  - File explorer designed for this type of work
  - Generally just better interface for working with website

- What I recommend
  - Atom.
    - Easy to use, clean, made by github so works really well
    - Download link and quickstart guide (everything needed to get started and make a webpage)

  - VSCode - What I use, more complicated but has more functionality. Recommended for those who want to do more than just webpages
    - Download link and more complex quickstart guide (if you are using vscode, hopefully you have coding background)
