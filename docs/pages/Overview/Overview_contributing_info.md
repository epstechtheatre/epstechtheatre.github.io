## Preamble
Before I scare anyone away, I would like to reassure you that you will not have to learn any coding language or HTML or anything to write wiki pages.

If you are reading this, you are likely interested in contributing to the wiki project. Fantastic! Hopefully this section can help you get all the information you need to get started. On the sidebar are several pages each tailoring to a different guide. They go into more depth than what is here.

## Starting Off
The wiki is entirely open-source; anyone in the world can look at and suggest changes in order to modify how the website looks. To manage this, we use Github. I have a lot of experience with Github personally, but to new comers, it can be quite intimidating. This page will quickly go over the fundamentals for how to contribute. Later pages in this section will include information on styling and more complex page elements.

### Create a Github account
To contribute, the first thing you will need is a Github account, they are free and only require an email. I suggest you don't use your school email as it gets deleted when you leave Grade 12. Make sure it's an email you are okay with sharing as all your contributions will be linked with it. Go to Github.com and hit sign up. Once you've done that you are set.

If you are not okay with sharing the email you used to sign up with, Github does provide a way to hide it in settings.

### Editing Existing Pages
The easiest way to contribute is by making changing to a page that already exists on the wiki. You might have noticed at the top of every page this is a "Improve this Page" button. when you click that, you will automatically be taken to the page's original copy on Github. There you can hit the "edit" button.

You might notice some difference to how the page looks on Github and on the Wiki. That is because on the Wiki the pages get stylized using a bunch of code that runs in the background. On Github, that code isn't allowed to run.

### Basic styling

- Github account
- Improve this page button
- How markdown works
