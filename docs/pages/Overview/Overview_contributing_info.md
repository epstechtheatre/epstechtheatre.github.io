## Preamble
Before I scare anyone away, I would like to reassure you that you will not have to learn any coding language or HTML or anything to write wiki pages.

If you are reading this, you are likely interested in contributing to the wiki project. Fantastic! Hopefully this section can help you get all the information you need to get started. On the sidebar are several pages each tailoring to a different guide. They go into more depth than what is here.

## Starting Off
The wiki is entirely open-source; anyone in the world can look at and suggest changes in order to modify how the website looks. To manage this, we use Github. I have a lot of experience with Github personally, but to new comers, it can be quite intimidating. This page will quickly go over the fundamentals for how to contribute. Later pages in this section will include information on styling and more complex page elements.

### Create a Github account
To contribute, the first thing you will need is a Github account, they are free and only require an email. I suggest you don't use your school email as it gets deleted when you leave the CBE. Make sure it's an email you are okay with sharing as all your contributions will be linked with it. Go to Github.com and hit sign up. Once you've done that you are set.

{% include note.html content="If you are not okay with sharing the email you used to sign up with, Github does provide a way to hide it in settings" %}

TODO: Show how to hide Github email in settings

## Editing Existing Pages
The easiest way to contribute is by making changes to a page that already exists on the wiki. You might have noticed at the top of every page, there is a button that says "Improve this Page". when you click that, you will automatically be taken to the source page on Github. There you can hit the "edit" button and make edits right from your browser.

{% include callout.html content="You might notice some differences to how the page looks on Github and on the Wiki. That is because on the Wiki the pages get stylized using a bunch of code that runs in the background. On Github, that code isn't allowed to run."%}

### Styling
Having blocks and blocks of plain text can quickly start to feel cluttered. Luckily, the web pages use a language called markdown. If you've ever sent an email or a message on Discord, you've already used markdown. Take a look at the [Styling Guide](Overview_styling.md) for more information.
