If you are reading this, you are likely interested in contributing to the wiki project. Fantastic! Hopefully this section can help you get all the information you need to get started. On the sidebar are several pages each tailoring to a different guide. They go into more depth than what is here.

# Getting started
The wiki is entirely open-source, that is to say, anyone in the world can look at, and suggest changes to the code that makes the website look that way it does. To manage this, we use Github.
